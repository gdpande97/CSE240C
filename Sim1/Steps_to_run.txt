Simulation Environment:

I used a M1 MacBook Pro to run all my simulations. I did not face any difficulty with running the traces and no changes had to be made to run the same.

Steps:
Building binaries:
I built all binaries with the following command:
./build_champsim.sh hashed_perceptron <prefetcher_file_name> next_line spp_dev no lru 1

I created multiple prefetcher codes for design space exploration and built a binary with each one of them. The binaries are present in the bin folder and the codes are present in the l1i_codes folder.

To run scripts for multiple traces, I created a textfile and filled it with all the traces. The traces are present in a folder ipc1_public. I modified the run_champsim.sh to make the Trace directory to ipc1_public. To fill the textfile I used following command : ls ipc1_public > benchmarks_all.txt

To run all the traces, I created a bash script called run_benchmarks.sh. The same file currently contains a sequential run of the scaling for the Barca prefetched. I used similar code to run all the binaries with all the benchmarks. 

I used a selection of 30 benchmarks for design space exploration. This is contained in the file benchmarks.txt in the repository.

All the result folders are named in a similar fashion as the binaries and are accumulated in a folder called results. 

I used a python script to scrape the data from the result files and generate resultant graphs. The script is included in script.py. It requires spicy to be installed as a dependency.

All the graphs are also kept in the results folder as PNG files.

To run any simulation, please copy the particular code file from l1i_codes folder to the prefetcher folder, build it using the command given above and run it with the trace as mentioned in the Champsim readme, or modify the run_benchmarks.sh to run multiple traces.

I ran the simulations overnight by running the run_benchmarks.sh and not allowing the pc to sleep.
