Compilation done using steps given in README.

All models are compiled for Config 2, which is simulating single core with prefetches enabled. The traces used are the same the the sets used in SHIP++.

new_script.py is used to run the data extraction and visualization. 

All results are contained in results folder, sorted into folders based in baseline, DSE or Size exploration. All binaries are similarly stored in the bin folder in the same fashion.

Run.sh is the script used to run batch jobs. I modified the same file to run different workloads on different executables. It was run in background using ./run.sh &

All graphs plotted(and a couple extra unused ones) are placed in the images folder.


Design Space Exploration is done by changing a file called <policy>_dse.cc 
For the SHIP++, changes are done in the MAX_RRPV value and NUM_LEADER_SETS variable for number of sampled sets.
FOR LIME, the hash functions are changed and their references across the code base. An example of both tag and pc is kept in two files lime_pc_hash and lime_tag_hash.
These are then compiled using the config files and binaries are created.
